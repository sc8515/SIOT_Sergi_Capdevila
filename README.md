Sensing Code:
- 
The code used in the Google Sheet's script editor can be found in WeatherAPICaller.

Time-series Data Analysis:
-
Download the DataVisualization folder and open SIOTCoursework_Data_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook in order to run the script and obtain the same graphs as in the report. The folder already contains all the data so the script will read the .csv files automatically. 

Weather App:
-
Download the project folder from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17_ckHAPXFfEpJq3NY8VKTbrM1lNQBAuY?usp=sharing) and open it using Android Studio. Make sure to have an API 26 Emulator or a smarthphone running Android Oreo.

Steps App:
-
Download the project folder from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15q9C5ZAS6t0bGG3JA0qaTGuzVfG16T-E?usp=sharing) and open it using Android Studio. Make sure to have a smarthphone running Android Oreo. In this case, it is not recommended to use and Emulator as there will be no access to the step_count sensor that exisits in smartphones. 

Note:
- 
Google Drive is used to store the Android Studio Projects, as github does not allow for more than 100 files to be uploaded at a time, and each project has over 2600 files.
